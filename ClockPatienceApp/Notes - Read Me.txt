Decisions rationale:

ArrayLists vs List Arrays:
	-Lists offer more performance when compared against ArrayLists, since it does not require boxing and unboxing (conversion of value types), since a list is made up of generics & type-safety.

Issue:
	-Currently the result clock (which holds the exposed cards in hour hands - with matching ranks), adds the card in each hour hand, instead of adding a card to its matching rank hour hand.

Other Notes:
Classes are built with the Seperation of Concerns in mind (mainly the DeckOfCards Class).
Methods are kept short with a single reponsibility (to follow the single responsibilty principle).

As an improvement, the methods which perform changes on the clock would be moved inside the Clock class & better encapsulation in the ClockPatienceLogic class.
